Python code simulating metal-silicate partitioning in an accreting planet 

Not well documented Python program for the simulation of metal-silicate partitioning during planetary accretion.
These files provide the numerical backbone framework for the computations published in Georg & Shahar 2015. 

I later added the interaction parameter approach to re-calculate elemental activity.
